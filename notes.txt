maybe screen saying hello and saying what program will do

##

if error, display in dialog box, and/or save in dir

##

don't put location of access file on frame. if no access file found,
say 'we couldn't find file in <dir>.'
open dialog box to have user locate file
say 'for future, please put file in <dir>'

instead of making log text files,
have it output to the program (text widget?)

test using file we have from Rima
